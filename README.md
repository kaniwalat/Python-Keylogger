ðŸ’»Python Keylogger


ðŸ’¬Description: This project is aimed at making a silent keylogger for the target machine using certain python libraries.
The aim is to collect vital information about the target machine by not attracting attention as much as possible.

1) Working Environment: Windows and Linux Systems
2) Written language: Python
3) Libraries used: keyboard, datetime, smtplib, time, socket, requests, os, pyautogui, wmi..ðŸ“š

How it works?
1) First of all, we need to convert our code into an exe file.
2) Then we blend our exe file with another file(png, jpeg, pdf, word..) we should shape it according to the victim's area of interest.
3) When our victim opens the application, a keylogger will be running in the background. Thus, we can see the victim's ip address, screenshots and keyboard movements.
4) The keylogger will send us the necessary information via gmail.
